Hi, I am Jennifer. Fully committed to the philosophy of life-long learning, I'm a frontend web developer with a passion for creating technology to solve users problems and all things web development. The unique combination of creativity, logic, technology and never running out of new things to discover, drives my excitement and passion for web development and computer science in general.When I'm not at my computer I like to spend my time learning new skills, working out and watching movies.
